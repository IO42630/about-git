| # | command | context | effect
| 1 | `git status` |  <master> | check if HEAD is pointing to <master>.
| 2 | `git checkout <master>` | <master> | switch to <master> if HEAD was pointing elsewhere in step 1.
| 3 | `git fetch` | <feature> | fetch (store a copy) latest changes
| 4 | `git pull <remote>` | <master> | pull (overwrite local branch) latest changes
| 5 | `git merge <feature>` | <master> | merge feature into <master>
